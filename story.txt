I came to suddenly, only to look down and see 2 things: I was both death-gripping a Bratwurst and found myself inexplicably in Lederhose.
My confusion continues when I look out the window of the Ratskeller to see a pack of wolves driving a Porsche.
There would be time later to figure out why I looked like I should be at a biergarten.  I gathered myself and checked my surrounding to decide on my next move.
A quiet crackling sounded behind me - followed by a dull applause, coming from the Klimaanlage. As a faint glow came from the vents, I peered inside, only to behold a miniaturized Rammstein concert - pyrotechnics and all!
